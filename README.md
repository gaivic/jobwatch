# jobwatch

jobwatch watches new-grad **SWE / ML / Quant** roles at the companies *you* choose and tells you only about the new ones.
A small Python bot runs on GitHub Actions every ~2 hours, pulls Simplify's New-Grad-Positions feed, filters it and sends
a Telegram digest of the postings you have not seen. A one-page **tracker** on GitHub Pages lists every open role and lets
you move each one through your pipeline (seen → applied → OA → interview → offer) from a phone or a laptop; your marks
sync between devices through this repo. No servers, no database, no cost — a public repo, Actions, Pages and a Telegram
bot token. This repo's tracker: **[gaivic.github.io/jobwatch](https://gaivic.github.io/jobwatch/)** (a fork gets its own at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`).

## How it works

**Feed.** [Simplify's New-Grad-Positions](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions) `listings.json` (~20k
records, ~3k live, refreshed about every 30 min). The bot scans every ~2 h (`23 */2 * * *` UTC) and right after you push
`jobwatch.py`, `config.json` or `companies.json` to `main`; GitHub may delay scheduled runs by minutes to hours.

**Filter**, in this order, for every live record:
1. **Company** — the name must contain one of your `companies.json` keywords as whole words on a normalised name
   (`d-matrix` matches `d-Matrix`; `snap` matches `Snap Inc.` but not `Snapchat`). A **deny list** removes look-alikes
   (`Snap-on`, `Millennium Physician Group`).
2. **Category** — Simplify's Software, AI/ML/Data or Quant. A **Hardware** role is rescued when its title looks like
   software (`software`, `cuda`, `compiler`, `kernel`, `firmware`, `embedded`, …) and not like silicon work (`rtl`,
   `asic`, `verification`, `physical design`, …).
3. **Degrees** — PhD-only roles are dropped using the feed's `degrees` field (PhD listed without a Bachelor's/Master's).
   `PhD` / `postdoc` / `doctoral` in the title always drops; "Research Scientist" drops only when the feed lists no degrees.
4. **Title** — senior / staff / principal / manager / director / "Software Engineer II" are dropped unless the title also
   says new grad, graduate, campus or early career; operator, labeler, annotator, technician, intern, co-op, trainee, pilot
   and similar are dropped regardless.
5. **Region** — US or Taiwan. `Remote`, `Remote in USA` / `Remote in US` count as US; `Remote in Canada` (or any other
   country) does not. Foreign cities and countries are recognised (`London, UK` and `Toronto, ON, Canada` are out;
   `Vancouver, WA` and `Dublin, OH` are in). No location at all passes.
6. **Sponsorship** — `Does Not Offer Sponsorship` / `U.S. Citizenship is Required` are dropped.
7. **Age** — a role must be ≤ 75 days old the first time it is seen; after that it is *sticky* and stays active exactly
   as long as the feed lists it.

Postings with the same company and title (parentheticals ignored) fold into one **group** row (`×2 · San Jose, CA;
Seattle, WA`); marks are always per posting. A role that leaves the feed becomes **closed**; one that is still listed but
no longer passes your filters becomes **not tracked**, with the reason (PhD-only, title, region, category, sponsorship,
company removed). Both stay visible under All / Closed / Untracked, and anything you marked is kept.

**Telegram.** One digest per scan that found something new: a header (`3 new roles · TikTok 2 · Cerebras 1`) linking to
the tracker's New view, then one block per company and one bullet per group — `[ML] Title — San Jose, CA · Seattle, WA
(2 postings) · BS/MS` — with every location linking to its own posting. A company folds after 8 lines into `+N more at
TikTok` (a link to that list); a run sends at most 4 messages and the rest follow ~2 h later. A role is announced once,
and only after Telegram accepted the message. The very first run sends a summary instead of a digest.

**Tracker.** Views (Inbox, New, Pipeline, Saved, All, …), one-tap Seen / Applied / Dismiss, notes, stars, undo, keyboard
shortcuts, the company list and settings editor, a Rescan button, CSV/JSON export. Marks live in `status.json` in this
repo and merge between devices last-writer-wins; without a token the page is a read-only mirror.

## Setup (~15 min)

1. **Telegram bot.** Message **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → copy the token. Send your bot any message (otherwise it cannot
   write to you). Message **@userinfobot** for your numeric chat id.
2. **Repo** — public (Pages is free only on public repos; nothing secret is stored here). **Fork** this repo, or start
   **fresh** from a complete copy of it (clone → push to a new repo, or GitHub's *Use this template* when it is enabled).
   Copy everything, not a hand-picked subset: `ci.yml` runs `tests/`, `tools/`, `e2e/` and `ruff.toml` on every push
   and stays red without them (drop `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/dependabot.yml` if you want the bot alone).
   Either way, before opening the tracker: Actions tab → enable workflows; add the secrets (step 3); commit
   `status.json` = `{}` and `manual.json` = `[]`; delete `seen.json` (so your first run sends *your* summary, not this
   repo's memory); optionally `roles.json` = `[]`; edit `companies.json` to your list.
3. **Secrets.** Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
4. **Pages.** Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main`, `/ (root)`. The tracker is at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`.
5. **First run.** Pushing `jobwatch.py`, `config.json` or `companies.json` to `main` runs the bot at once; otherwise
   Actions → **jobwatch** → Run workflow (tick `dry_run` to rehearse without writing or sending). It writes `roles.json`,
   `meta.json`, `seen.json`, fills the two generated sections of this README and sends the Telegram summary.
6. **Sync token (optional).** The page reads your public files without a token — a token is only needed to write.
   GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens: *Only select repositories* → this repo; permissions
   **Contents: Read and write** and **Actions: Read and write** (for Rescan). Tracker → **Sync** → `owner/repo` + token →
   **Save & verify**. Repeat per device; the token never leaves that browser.
7. **iPhone.** Share → **Add to Home Screen**. Safari deletes a site's storage after 7 days without a visit; the Home
   Screen app has its own storage — paste the token there once.
8. **Quiet hours (optional).** The bot scans every ~2 h around the clock. Settings → Quiet hours (e.g. 23–8
   `America/Los_Angeles`) holds digests until the first scan after the window.

## Using the tracker

- **Views.** Inbox (active, unmarked), New (Inbox ∩ since your last visit or the last 36 h), Pipeline (applied → offer,
  grouped by stage with dates and a "no update 3w" nudge), Saved (★), All (with a hide-closed toggle) and, under More,
  each stage plus Closed and Untracked. Chips SWE / ML / Quant / HW, search and sort intersect any view; the URL hash
  holds the view, so a link reproduces it.
- **Marks.** Quick actions Seen / Applied / Dismiss, a stage select, ★ and a note per role. Changes sync within ~2 s;
  **Undo** in the toast (or `u`) restores exactly what was there, history included.
- **Groups.** One row per company + title with `×N` and a chip per posting (own link, own stage). Seen / Dismiss / ★
  apply to members still "to review"; Applied and later stages go to the single open member — with two or more the row
  expands and asks *Which posting?*
- **Company actions.** `Seen all` / `Dismiss all` in the company header; one Undo covers all of them.
- **Keyboard.** `?` lists the shortcuts; `j` / `k` move, `u` (or Ctrl+Z) undoes. Ignored while you type.
- **NEW badge** on roles that appeared since your last visit; the New tab counts the same set.
- **Pills.** The scan pill says when the bot last ran — "scanned 2h ago" with a token (from the Actions API) or "bot
  alive 14h ago" without one (from `meta.json`; the bot commits only when something changed, at least once a day). The
  sync pill reads Synced / Syncing… / N unsaved / Sync failing / Read-only / Local only; the footer repeats it in words.
- **Banners** are specific: new roles since your visit, sync off on this device, a sync error with its reason, offline
  with the pending count, `roles.json` failed to load, bot silent for > 26 h, settings changed since the last scan,
  marks on this device that are not in your repo (once, after upgrading — Discard unless you recognise them), a newer
  page version exists.
- **Companies dialog.** Every keyword with its active count (`0 ever` = never matched a name in the feed), the names it
  matched and `denied N`; add (previews how it will match, e.g. `d matrix`), remove (confirms when it hides roles),
  **Block this name** (adds to `config.deny`), **Rescan now** (dispatches the workflow and reports the outcome
  truthfully: "+3 new roles", "no new matches", "Scan failed"). Saving also triggers a scan within a minute.
- **Settings.** Theme; toggles for Hardware rescue, the Research-Scientist rule, regions US / TW and quiet hours; the
  `config.json` editor with Validate / Save / Reset to defaults; Export CSV / JSON; "Clear local marks on this device".

## Configuration

`config.json` is optional — without it the defaults in `jobwatch.py` apply. Create it from Settings → Save (writes the
effective config) or by hand. A key in the file **replaces** the default for that key (lists are not merged; a nested object such as `feed` or
`telegram` may omit sub-keys — they are filled from the defaults with a warning in `meta.json`); an unknown
key warns; a wrong type stops the run (exit 2) naming the key; a regex fragment that does not compile falls back to its
default with a warning in `meta.json`. Every change needs a scan — saving from Settings triggers one.

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `feed_url` | Simplify `listings.json` | Feed URL (`https://`). |
| `regions` | `["US", "TW"]` | Regions kept; `[]` = no region filter. |
| `categories` | `["Software", "Software Engineering", "AI/ML/Data", "Data Science, AI & Machine Learning", "Quant"]` | Simplify categories kept. |
| `hardware_rescue` | `{"enabled": true, "include": [...], "exclude": [...]}` | Admit `Hardware` roles whose title matches an include fragment and no exclude fragment. |
| `title_exclude` | regex fragments | Titles dropped (`senior`, `staff … engineer`, `operator`, `intern`, `trainee`, …). |
| `title_seniority` | subset of `title_exclude` | The fragments a `title_keep` hit waives. |
| `title_keep` | `["new grad", "graduate", "campus", "early careers?", "entry level", …]` | New-grad signals. |
| `phd_title` | `["ph\\.?\\s?d", "postdoc", "post-doc", "post doc", "doctoral"]` | Always dropped, whatever `degrees` says. |
| `research_title` | `["research scientist"]` | Dropped only when the feed lists no degrees. |
| `bs_ms_degrees` | `["Bachelor's", "Master's", "Associate's", "MBA"]` | A role is PhD-only iff `PhD` is listed and none of these. |
| `deny` | list of names | Company names (normalised, whole words) never matched. |
| `bad_sponsorship` | `["U.S. Citizenship is Required", "Does Not Offer Sponsorship"]` | Sponsorship values dropped. |
| `max_age_days` · `archive_days` | `75` · `180` | Age limit for *new* ids · how long closed / untracked rows without a keep-mark stay in `roles.json`. |
| `keep_marks` | `["applied", "oa", "interview", "offer", "rejected"]` | Stages (plus any ★ or note) that exempt a row from pruning. |
| `feed` | `{"min_records": 1000, "min_active": 200, "min_active_ratio": 0.7, "required_keys": [...]}` | Feed sanity gates (exit 1, nothing written). |
| `archive_gate` | `{"max_closed_fraction": 0.5, "min_prev_active": 20}` | Refuse to close more than half of the active roles in one run (exit 4; `force` overrides). |
| `telegram` | `{"html": true, "max_lines_per_company": 8, "max_messages_per_run": 4, "pace_seconds": 1.1, "chunk_chars": 3500, "deep_link": true, "deadline_seconds": 180, "quiet_hours": null}` | Digest shape; `quiet_hours` = `{"start": 23, "end": 8, "tz": "America/Los_Angeles"}` holds digests in the window. |
| `readme.collapse_over` | `20` | Companies with more roles than this render collapsed in the list below. |
| `pages_url` | `null` | Overrides the derived tracker URL (custom domains, local runs). |

Regex fragments are wrapped as `(?<![a-z0-9])(?:FRAG)(?![a-z0-9])`, case-insensitive, identically in Python and in the
page's validator — use only the shared subset (`\b \s \w ? + * | () [] \.`). `companies.json` is a JSON array of
lowercase keywords, edited from the Companies dialog or by hand.

## State files, backup, restore, reset

| File | Written by | Shape | Safe to delete? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `roles.json` | bot | array of roles, active and archived | Yes — rebuilt on the next run; archived history is lost. |
| `meta.json` | bot | run metadata, per-keyword counts, warnings | Yes — recreated; the scan pill reads "unknown" until then. |
| `seen.json` | bot | sorted ids already announced | Yes — the next run sends the summary and re-seeds (no per-role re-pings). |
| `status.json` | tracker (and `tools/backfill_marks.py`, run by you) | `{id: {s, star, note, t, h}}` or `{id: {d}}` | **No** — your marks. Reset = commit `{}` after hard-reloading every device. |
| `companies.json` | tracker; the bot only seeds it when absent | array of keywords | Yes — re-seeded with the defaults. |
| `manual.json` | tracker | roles you added by hand | Yes, if you have none. |
| `config.json` | tracker Settings, or you | object | Yes — the defaults apply. |
| `README.md` | bot, only between the two marker pairs | — | — |

- **Backup:** `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> jw-backup && tar czf jw-backup.tgz jw-backup`.
- **Restore marks:** `git checkout <sha> -- status.json && git commit -m "restore marks" && git push`, then Settings →
  Clear local marks on each device (or just wait: last-writer-wins adopts the repo copy for anything older).
- **Reset the bot's memory:** delete or empty `seen.json` → the next run sends the summary only and re-seeds.
- **`tools/backfill_marks.py`** (once, locally): reads the git history of `status.json` and gives every legacy mark its
  real change time and stage history, so Pipeline shows dates. `python3 tools/backfill_marks.py` prints the diff;
  `--write` applies it; review, commit, push. Idempotent — existing times are never overwritten.

## Running and testing locally

```
python3 jobwatch.py --dry-run --verbose --feed listings.json --state-dir /tmp/jw     # always --dry-run first
python3 jobwatch.py --explain "NVIDIA" "GPU Architecture Engineer New Grad" --degrees "Master's" --locations "Santa Clara, CA"
```
`--dry-run` runs the whole pipeline, gates included, prints counts, the would-be Telegram text and the files that would
change, and writes nothing. `--feed` takes a local snapshot (`curl -o listings.json <feed_url>`); `--state-dir` points at
a *copy* of the state files — never run inside your clone without it. A run without `--dry-run` and without Telegram
credentials writes files and prints a loud line saying the new roles were **not** marked seen (`--no-notify` marks them
seen without alerts). Never hand-commit `roles.json`, `seen.json`, `meta.json` or the generated README sections.

Page: `cp -r . /tmp/jw-page && cd /tmp/jw-page && python3 -m http.server 8000`, open `http://localhost:8000/`, and in
Sync save `owner/repo` **without** a token for read-only testing. Never paste a token into a `file://` page (the page
refuses). Tests: `python3 -m pytest -q`, `ruff check jobwatch.py tools tests`, `node --test 'tests/js/*.test.mjs'`,
`python3 tests/check_html.py`; Playwright: `cd e2e && npm ci`, then from the repo root `PW_CHANNEL=chrome node --test
'e2e/*.spec.mjs'` (system Chrome; CI installs chromium). Details in [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| Nothing on Telegram | The run log's annotations say why: `400 chat not found` → message the bot first; `403` → you blocked the bot; `401` → wrong token. Digests are held during quiet hours; a role is announced once — check the New view. |
| Red run, exit 1 | Feed unreachable or degenerate (too few records, schema drift, live count < 70 % of the last run) — nothing written. One Telegram after the second consecutive scheduled failure. Set `feed_url` if Simplify moved the file. |
| Red run, exit 2 | A state or config file is corrupt or the wrong shape — the message names it; fix or delete it. Also any unexpected internal error (traceback in the run log). Nothing written. |
| Red run, exit 3 | Files were written and committed, but every Telegram message failed; the roles are re-announced next run. |
| Red run, exit 4 | Gate: `refused to close N roles in one run` (feed hiccup?) or 0 matches with a non-empty company list. Re-run with the `force` input if it is real. |
| "Sync failing" banner | The reason is in the banner: token invalid or expired → new token; can't write → give it Contents: Read and write; repo or file not found → check `owner/repo`; `status.json` not valid JSON → fix it on GitHub. Marks stay safe on the device until Retry succeeds. |
| Read-only / rate limit | Without a token the page never calls the GitHub API (so the anonymous 60/h limit cannot bite) and cannot write; it mirrors the Pages copy, up to 10 min behind. Add a token to write. |
| Page shows old data | Pages caches for up to 10 min; the page tolerates old data in both directions. Hard-reload once after a release. |
| Scheduled runs late or gone | GitHub delays cron under load and disables schedules after 60 days without commits; the bot's heartbeat commit (at most one a day) prevents that, and any push re-enables. |

## What is public

In a public repo anyone can read the role list (`roles.json`, this README), your **stages per company** in `status.json`
(and its git history), your notes, `companies.json`, `manual.json` and `config.json`. Not public: the Telegram token and
chat id (Actions secrets) and your GitHub token (stored only in your browser, only after it verified, never on a
`file://` page). Shipped mitigations: `noindex`, `no-referrer`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on every link, no personal
names in code or comments. Keep notes free of anything you would not put in a public commit. **Private-repo recipe:**
GitHub Pro or the Student Pack allows Pages on a private repo — move `index.html`, `assets/`, `manifest.webmanifest`
and `.nojekyll` into `docs/`, set Pages to `/docs`, and give every device a token: the page's same-origin fetch of
`roles.json` 404s and it falls back to the Contents API.
